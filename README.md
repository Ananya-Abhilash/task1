## Titanic Dataset - Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

This project demonstrates how to clean and preprocess raw data using the **Titanic dataset** — a popular dataset for practicing machine learning. The goal is to prepare the dataset for machine learning by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, normalizing features, and visualizing outliers.

---

## 📌 Objective

Learn how to clean and prepare raw data for machine learning models.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

- **Python**  
- **Pandas** – for data manipulation  
- **NumPy** – for numerical operations  
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** – for visualization  
- **Scikit-learn** – for encoding and scaling  

---

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset used is the Titanic dataset (`titanic.csv`). It contains information about passengers aboard the Titanic, such as age, sex, fare, and survival status.

## ✅ What You'll Learn

- Data cleaning and handling missing values  
- Encoding categorical features  
- Normalizing numerical features  
- Identifying and visualizing outliers  

---


## 💡 Notes

- The code is compatible with future versions of pandas (e.g., avoids `inplace=True` warnings).
- Columns like `Name`, `Ticket`, and `PassengerId` can be dropped before modeling if not useful.
